Question 1:

Choose any editor as your favorite and list 3 reasons why you like it most. 
You can write a reason with one paragraph each. 
Note that you need to describe concretely and concisely, 
e.g., "I can edit faster" is neither concrete or concise because of the lack of a comparison basis.

Answer 1:

Question 2: 
Generate several .txt, .bak and .py files.  Then write a shell script to change the .txt file 
names to new_{old_name}.txt, delete all .bak files and change the names of .py files to 
long_{old_name}.py or short_{old_name}.py depending on the condition that the number of lines 
in each of .py files is >= 10 lines or not.

Answer 2:

change file names: 
for f in *.txt do mv "$f" "new_${f}"

delete .bak files:
rm -rf *.bak

rename .py files:
for x in *.py
do c =`cat $x|wc -l`
if test $c -e 10 then mv "$x" "short_${x}"
else  "$x" "long_${x}"
